This repository follows my evolving DevFlow approach. Individual work for FEND project 6. No collaboration or pull requests expected. Started with standalone repository and added baseline code from course - see commit messages for history.

This repository used the reactnd-project-myreads-starter repo at commit 456b9c8a47e96e3b728964aa0aab183a59c2943c

As such, no contributions will be allowed. This repo reflects my work and iteration for project submission and learning exercises. Please see README.md for full list of guides and content used in completing project.
